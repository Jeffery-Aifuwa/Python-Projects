# Caesar Cipher

This project is an implementation of the Caesar cipher, one of the simplest encryption techniques.  
It works by shifting each letter in the alphabet by a chosen number.

## Functions
- `encrypt(text, shift)`  
  Encrypts the given text using the shift value.

- `decrypt(text, shift)`  
  Decrypts the text back to the original message using the same shift value.

## Example
encrypt("hello", 3) → "khoor"
decrypt("khoor", 3) → "hello"
