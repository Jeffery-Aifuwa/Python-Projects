# Python Projects

This folder contains a collection of small Python projects I’m building as I learn Python.  
Most of these were done while following the freeCodeCamp curriculum, along with some additional practice projects.

Each project focuses on a specific concept such as functions, string manipulation, loops, lists, file handling, and basic algorithms.

More projects will be added as I continue learning.
